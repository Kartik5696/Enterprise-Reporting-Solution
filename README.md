# Enterprise-Reporting-Solution
Case Study

The Ministry of the Environment (MOE) in Alberta has a need to design and implement a reporting system that satisfied two data sets known as:

1. Toxics Reporting and Information System (“TRAIS”)
2. Greenhouse Gas Information System (“GHGIS”)

This reporting system needs to capture each data set separately but utilize the same reporting infrastructure and processes for data capture, data cleansing, and reporting.
The business case submitted by Margaret John, Manager of the Environmental Management Branch was approved with a budget of received approval from her by the Environmental Management Branch for this initiative was approved for 1.7M. The scope of the project is defined as:

Utilizing existing IT and Reporting Infrastructure to build out the TRAIS/GHGIS reporting solution

 Implement new enterprise reporting tools
 Partner with the Ministry of Environment to collect the data from the various
organizations mandated to report toxics and greenhouse gas emissions into the
atmosphere
 Build a solution using web services to capture and transform data
 Build adhoc and canned reports
 Make reports available internal groups and external to the public

This project would procure a vendor team to complete majority of the development work and to
create the architecture documentation needed to get through a governance process and to maintain
the solution. This vendor team would be supported by internal full time technical staff, and where
there staff gaps, fee for service consultants would be hired to fill those gaps.

This case study provides the necessary details a project manager would need to build the
integration project plan and to establish the essential project processes to manage the execution of
the project.
